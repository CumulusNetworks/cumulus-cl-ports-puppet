## Overview

This Puppet module provides a simple interface for managing initial port configuration
on Cumulus Linux

## Module Description

The cumulus_ports module  is responsible for setting the initial speed of 10G or
40G port. On some bare metal switches, it is possible to take a 40G port and split it up
into four 10G ports using a breakout cable. For more details, visit [Cumulus
Linux User Guide](http://docs.cumulusnetworks.com) and search for
"Switch Port Attributes"

## Setup

### What cumulus_ports affects

* This module affects the `/etc/cumulus/ports.conf` file
* To activate the changes in the file, the `switchd` daemon must be restarted
> **NOTE**: restarting the `switchd` daemon is disruptive


### Beginning with cumulus_ports

This module does not use any default parameters. Support for default parameters is on the roadmap.

## Usage

The module currently supports one defined type, `cumulus_ports::speeds`
```
node default {
  cumulus_ports { 'speeds':
    speed_10g => "swp5-48",
    speed_40g => ["swp49","swp51-52"],
    speed_40g_div_4 => "swp1-4",
    speed_4_by_10g => "swp50",
  }
}

```

## Reference

### Custom Type
  * `cumulus_ports`:  generates a custom /etc/cumulus/ports.conf based
  on the following variables:
  * `speed_10g`: `speed_10g => 'swp1-2'` will produce the following text in /etc/cumulus/ports.conf

    ```
    swp1=10G
    swp2=10G
    ```

  * `speed_40g` : `speed_40g => 'swp1-2'` will produce the following text in /etc/cumulus/ports.conf

    ```
    swp1=40G
    swp2=40G
    ```

  * `speed_40g_div_4`: `speed_40g_div_4 => ['swp1', 'swp4']` will produce text  in /etc/cumulus/ports.conf

    ```
    swp1=40/4
    swp4=40/4
    ```

  * `speed_4_by_10g`: `speed_4_by_10g => 'swp1-2'` will produce the following text in /etc/cumulus/ports.conf

    ```
    swp1=4x10G
    swp2=4x10G
    ```

## Limitations

This module only works on Cumulus Linux.

The module, currently, does not do any error
checking. Ensure all config is thoroughly tested or the switch can
behave in unpredictable ways.

## Development

1. Fork it.
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`).
5. Create new Pull Request.
